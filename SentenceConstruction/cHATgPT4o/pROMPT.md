### vocabulary table

- he table should only include nouns, verbs, adverbs and adjective.
- do not provide particles in the vocabulary, student needs to figure this the correct particles
- the table of vocabulary should only have the following columns: Japanese, romaji, english

- if there is more than one version of a word, show the simplest version.

### sentence structure
